Hi! I'm Pedro, a mobile developer with Flutter Framework.
I'm also a Computer Science student at Federal Institute of Science, Education and Technology from State of Ceará (IFCE).

One of my favorite activities is software development. I really like the idea that I can create something useful for people.
That's why I develop mobile applications.

My favorite languages are:

- Dart, with the Flutter Framework — I'm actually working with this.
- Python3, because this was my first language, and I enjoy data science.

If you want know me better, my contact information is right above. Thanks for your attention!
